Everylane
---------

#### Who
I, Aaron Bauman, am a Drupal developer and a person who rides a bike.

#### What
This Drupal module is designed to orchestrate a twitter bot into posting pictures of bike lanes.

#### When
The bot, [https://twitter.com/everylanephilly](https://twitter.com/everylanephilly), should be tweeting about once an hour for a year, from the summer of 2019 through the summer of 2020.

#### How
First, you need a Drupal site. More instructions TK.

#### Where
This module is specific to Philadelphia. Support for additional cities TK.

#### Why
Inspired by the [everylot bots like everylotphilly](https://twitter.com/everylotphilly) I thought it would be interesting to build a similar bot to show what Philadelphia's bike network looks like. I hope the pictures will help shape your opinion about our infrastructure.


## Developer information
I'll be posting TODOs into the issues section. Level of interest from other parties will determine how much time I spend making this adaptable to other cities.
